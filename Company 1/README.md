# This tool works in conjunction with a certain set of files available on a company tool. This company has 50+ tools across the country to maintain and the MFC-EV.py script is the one that maintains version control across these. In conjunction with an Excel file, the version control tool recursively iterates through a dynamic list of directories and subdirectories to compare files and determine critical differences.
# I chose to use Python and Excel because the company is extremely familiar with Excel and I knew the power Python has when taking advantage of libraries such as Pandas.
